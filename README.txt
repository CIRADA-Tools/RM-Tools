IMPORTANT NOTE:
The master and develop branches of RM-tools are no longer being actively maintained.
The cirada branch is the up-to-date, maintained and developed version of RM-tools.
The cirada branch has been updated to Python 3; the master branch has been left for Python 2 compatability but will not receive updates except for critial bugs (at our discretion).

Questions, bug reports, and feature requests can be sent to Cameron Van Eck, cameron.van.eck (at) dunlap.utoronto.ca.
